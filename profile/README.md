**fleximq** is a flexible message queuing protocol designed for high performance, reliability, and versatile communication across distributed systems. It provides a standardized way for applications to exchange messages asynchronously, supporting a rich set of communication patterns.

## Vision

The vision behind fleximq is to create a **versatile, programming language-agnostic, and cross-platform messaging ecosystem**. We aim to deliver:

- **Efficiency**: Optimized for speed and low overhead.
- **Clarity**: Clear and well-defined semantics for all operations.
- **Flexibility**: Support for diverse communication patterns including:
  - Request/Response
  - Publish/Subscribe
  - Notifications
- **Broad Applicability**: Suitable for a wide range of applications, from complex distributed systems and microservice architectures to plugin systems and Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Offering a more comprehensive suite of communication modes compared to traditional protocols like MQTT.

fleximq empowers developers to build robust, scalable, and decoupled applications with ease.
